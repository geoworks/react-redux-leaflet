react-redux-leaflet
===================

Full low-level Leaflet power + React + Redux
with all the necessary boilerplate done for you.
Helps a lot and gets out of the way once you need to access Leaflet guts.

Quite usable but badly documented :)

How to run the example
----------------------

```sh
git clone https://github.com/burmisov/react-redux-leaflet
cd react-redux-leaflet
npm install
npm run example
```
